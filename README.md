# jest-test-team-generator

## Description
The purpose of this project is to utilize the Jest testing library and build tests around development components.  
In addition, I used fs to write the html document, and Inquirer to take user input.

## Tests Passing Demo
In this challenge, 4 objects were built, and the components within those objects tested.
As seen below, all tests pass.
